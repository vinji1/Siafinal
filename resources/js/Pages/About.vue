    <h1>About us</h1>

        We built Xbox for people like you for players from all walks of life, everywhere in the world, who all want the same thing: a place to play and have fun. We need your help keeping the Xbox community safe and fun for everyone.

        While the Code of Conduct section of the Microsoft Services Agreement applies to all Microsoft products, Xbox offers so many ways to interact with others that it benefits from an additional level of explanation.

To this end, we’ve created the following community standards for Xbox. Consider these standards a roadmap for contributing to this incredible, globe-spanning community. Remember: the Xbox community is yours. We all bring something unique, and that uniqueness is worth protecting.

        Whether you’re brand new to gaming or have been playing for decades, we need you to be stewards of this place, to protect each other even as you compete. Because when everyone plays, we all win.

        Some parts of the internet don’t have rules—and the Xbox community isn’t one of them. Yes, Xbox is, in a meaningful sense, your gaming network. But it belongs to millions of others, too. You deserve a place to be yourself with confidence, free from bullying, hatred, and harassment—and so does every other player. So it’s important to treat others as they would like to be treated.
